## üö® The Critical Problem

### The Choking Crisis by Numbers

```mermaid
pie title "Choking Statistics Global Impact"
    "Deaths every 3 minutes" : 1
    "Brain damage onset (4 min)" : 1
    "Lifetime choking risk (33%)" : 1
    "Current training success rate (47%)" : 1
```

### Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Global choking deaths** | Every 3 minutes | SJTREM 2025 |
| **Brain damage onset** | 4 minutes after airway blockage | Resuscitation Council UK |
| **Lifetime choking risk** | 1 in 3 people (33%) | Medical research |
| **Heimlich success rate** | Only 47% | Japan EMS study |
| **Singapore annual trainees** | >120,000 people | Singapore Heart Foundation/SCDF |
| **Skill retention decline** | Significant after 3-6 months | Training studies |

### Consequences of Poor Training

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Too Little Force
- Airway remains blocked
- Victim continues choking
- Death or brain damage

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Too Much Force
- Gastric ruptures
- Rib fractures
- Myocardial injury
- Internal organ damage
- Especially dangerous for elderly/vulnerable groups

    style F fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Opening Hook (Kai Jie - 30 seconds)
> "Every 3 minutes, someone in the world dies from choking. And when the airway is blocked, you have just 4 minutes before brain damage begins. It's not rare ‚Äî 1 in 3 people will experience a choking episode in their lifetime. But the way we train today doesn't prepare people to save lives tomorrow. Courses rely on static mannequins to teach, or even worse, simply ask participants to simulate doing the Heimlich maneuver. Assessments are just about going through the motions ‚Äî there's no way to verify correct technique. Would someone trained in this manner really be confident to perform such maneuvers in the real world?"

### Closing Impact Statement (Daniel - 35 seconds)
> "With RescueRight: People learn the skill accurately with confidence; rescues will be more effective and safer‚Äîespecially for vulnerable groups like the elderly. Every 3 minutes, someone dies from choking. RescueRight ensures that when someone is choking, rescuers can act confidently and safely. We're not just improving training. We're creating a smarter and safer standard for lifesaving."

## üí≠ Final Thoughts

RescueRight represents more than just a training tool‚Äîit's a paradigm shift in how we prepare people to save lives. By transforming "invisible" forces into measurable, teachable moments, we're not just improving training; we're setting a new standard for emergency response preparation.

Our journey from idea to prototype demonstrates the power of innovation when applied to critical human needs. With every sensor calibrated and every line of code written, we move closer to a world where no one dies from choking due to inadequate rescue attempts.

**Together, we're making every rescue right.**
